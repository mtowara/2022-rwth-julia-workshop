    "### Getting all the rest\n",
    "The easiest way to get the remaining files and dependencies\n",
    "is to [download the install.jl script](https://github.com/mtowara/2022-rwth-julia-workshop/blob/master/install.jl) and run it from julia. See the instructions [on the github repository](https://github.com/mfherbst/2022-rwth-julia-workshop).\n",

    "As an alternative you can also also run the following commands manually\n",
